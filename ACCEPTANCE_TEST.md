# Programming

Plug the micro-USB port on the edge of td-io into a computer. It will appear as a USB flash drive. Drag and drop the firmware U2F file onto the flash drive. When programming is complete, the drive will disconnect automatically.

Once programmed, the white button must be held when plugging in the USB cable to re-enter programming mode.

# Basic test

1. Power the board via a JAMMA supergun.

2. Measure the pins on the JVS power connector and make sure the +3.3V line measures between 3.27V and 3.39V.

3. Ensure the volume pot turns smoothly and is not loose.

4. Set the switch default positions to 2 coin chutes and mono sound.

# Functionality test

4. Attach a JVS host to the JVS connectors. Ensure that the green LED illuminates once the host initializes JVS.

5. Attach a sound source to the RCA connectors. Ensure that the sound is audible via either the JAMMA connector or via the stereo header.

6. Attach a video source to the VGA connector. Ensure that video appears via the supergun.
